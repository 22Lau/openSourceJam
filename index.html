                <p>Hello, I'm T'zar, an alien from Xerion, a planet in the Andromeda constellation. I'm a stellar
                    programmer,
                    and my passion lies in technology and programming.</p>
                    

                <p>In Xerion, we have achieved advanced levels in cosmic software development. My work focuses on
                    optimizing
                    spaceship systems and communication. I also enjoy composing music and designing interactive
                    holographs.</p>


                <p>I'm thrilled to continue exploring and advancing science and technology on my planet and beyond.
                    Occasionally, I take a stroll through other worlds in search of junior talent.</p>

The programmers were in a test to demonstrate their skills not only in programming but also as teammates within their own team and with the rest of the participants. It's the Interasco humans who are responsible for choosing the winning team... I wouldn't want to be in their position because I have seen the work that each team has done, and even with my mind, which is superior light-years ahead of the human mind, I can't come up with a winning team by inputting variables into my supercomputer..."

They have had a tough job selecting the winning team, as it seems there can only be one...
